## Introduction

I have updated my personal site to replace the previous plain Markdown-based site. The new site is built on Jekyll, allowing for better presentation and easier organization of my content.

## Migration of Content

I will be transferring the content from the `Useful Links` section of the old site into individual blog posts that explain how the projects work. This process will take some time, but I will complete it gradually.

## Useful Links from the Previous Page

- The repository for this site: [这个主页的储存库](https://github.com/Anson2251/Anson2251.github.io)
- Sequence Calculator: [数列计算器](https://anson2251.github.io/sequence/)
- Binomial Expansion Calculator: [展开 (a+b)^n](https://anson2251.github.io/binomial-expansion-calculator/)
- Solve2048 Demo: [solve2048 demo](https://anson2251.github.io/solve2048/)

## Why Jekyll?

Jekyll is a convenient tool for transforming plain text, written in Markdown, into static websites and blogs, which suits my preferences perfectly. GitHub also supports Jekyll with workflows for building and hosting the site online, allowing for a smooth transition.

## Future Posts

In upcoming posts, I will explain the design ideas behind the projects listed in the `Useful Links` section. I will also refurbish the projects and update the README files for each project.
