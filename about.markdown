This site is built for my weird ideas I come up with and to record what I learn from making various interesting projects.

The blogs and pages are organised by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with theme [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima), the content is licensed under the MIT licence, but for the demo of each project it is licensed under its own licence.

You can find the source code of this website in this [repository](https://github.com/anson2251/anson2251.github.io).
